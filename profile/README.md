We're a group of CTF enthusiasts from Slovakia and Czechia who enjoy the challenge of solving security problems. We're always looking for new ways to improve our skills and knowledge. Here, you can find our write-ups and solutions to some of the CTFs and their challenges! Passion and joy drive us, not profit.
